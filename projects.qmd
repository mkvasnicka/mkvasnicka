## Selected Past Projects

#### Creation of Advanced Traffic Accident Analysis Tools for the Police of the Czech Republic

supported by TAČR grant TL02000122 | for the Police of the Czech Republic | with [Štěpán Mikula](https://sites.google.com/site/stepanmikula/), Josef Montag, and Josef Bolcha

We developed software to identify and visualize hazardous sections of road networks, and to display general accident statistics. A demonstration version of the software is available [here](https://trafficacc.econ.muni.cz/).

#### Merger simulation in markets with homogeneous product and spatial differentiation

supported by TAČR grant TL02000122 | for the Office for the Protection of Competition | with [Rostislav Staněk](https://sites.google.com/view/rostislavstanek) and [Ondřej Krčál](https://sites.google.com/view/ondrej-krcal/)

We developed software **MergerSim** to analyze fuel market mergers for the Czech Competition Authority. It forecasts price changes (overall and at specific stations) and recommends obligations to maintain competition. This tool aids decision-making in a market prone to mergers. The software is implemented in the R computing environment.

#### Collusion detection in public procurement

supported by TAČR grant TD03000121 | for the Office for the Protection of Competition | with [Rostislav Staněk](https://sites.google.com/view/rostislavstanek) and [Ondřej Krčál](https://sites.google.com/view/ondrej-krcal/)

This project delivered a methodology and software for the OCA to uncover collusion in public procurement. The system pinpoints suspect contracts and sectors, and the methodology guides the OCA in gathering additional evidence for formal investigations.
