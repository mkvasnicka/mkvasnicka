It forecasts price changes (overall and at specific stations) and recommends obligations to maintain competition. This tool aids decision-making in a market prone to mergers. The software is implemented in the R computing environment.\nDownloads:\n\nMergerSim: merger simulation and visualization software\n\n\n\n\n\nCollusion detection in public procurement\nsupported by TAČR grant TD03000121 | for the Office for the Protection of Competition | with Rostislav Staněk and Ondřej Krčál\nThis project delivered a methodology and software for the OCA to uncover collusion in public procurement.
